# coolProj
An imaginary repository for reference during the creation of a GitHub User Guide.  This guide will contain steps to setting up GitHub, working within a clone, and merging the changes together.  The idea behind this guide is to provide support to future Siena Software Engineering students who have a team leader and team members who are collaborating on a project.
